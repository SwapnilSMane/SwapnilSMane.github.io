      <strong>KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION : AGGRESSION DETECTION USING MINI BERT</strong> <i>[JAN 2022 - APR 2022]</i></p>
    <p>
      The knowledge is transferred from the BERT base to mini BERT (3-layers)
      using knowledge distillation, which is 7.5x smaller and 9.4x faster on
      inference. <br>

    <p>
      Relation classifier with new information on entity embeddings utilizing
        Pre-trained BERT. Over the state-of-the-art strategy, this suggested
        model achieves significant performance on the KnowldgeNet relational
        dataset. <br>

      <strong>ANALYSIS OF AUTHOR’S ABUSIVE BEHAVIOUR COMMUNITY ON TWITTER</strong> <i>[JAN 2022 - APR 2022]</i></p>
    <p>
      This project briefly analyzes the author’s Abusive Behavior Network
        (ABN) by comparing it to the Normal Behavior Network (NBN). For analysis, the report uses social network analysis measures and
        effectively concludes that ABN has a densified network, information has
        spread rapidly, and much more. It also identifies the topics the author
        has been abusive on. This study will undoubtedly aid in distinguishing
        between the author’s abusive and normal communities. [<a

      <strong>POLARITY BASED SARCASM DETECTION USING SEMIGRAPH</strong> <i>[JAN 2022 - APR 2022]</i></p>
    <p>
     A variation of the semigraph is suggested in the pattern-relatedness of
        the text document. The proposed method is to obtain the sarcastic and
        non-sarcastic polarity scores of a document using a semigraph.</p>

      <strong>THEMATIC CONTEXT VECTOR ASSOCIATION BASED ON EVENT UNCERTAINTY FOR
        TWITTER</strong> <i>[JAN 2022 - APR 2022]</i></p>
    <p>
     In this project, keywords are extracted using contextual events with the
        help of data association. The thematic context vectors for events are
        identified using uncertainty principle in the proposed system. The
        system is tested on the twitter COVID-19 dataset and proves to be
        effective. The system extracts event specific thematic context vectors from the
        test dataset and ranks them. The extracted thematic context vectors are
        used for the clustering of contextual thematic vectors which improves
        silhouette coefficient by 0.5% than state of art methods namely TF and
        TF-IDF. The thematic context vector can be used in other applications like Cyber
        bullying, sarcasm detection, figurative language detection etc. [<a

      <strong>IDENTIFICATION OF CERTAIN ENTITIES OF EACH EVENTS FROM TWITTER</strong> <i>[JAN 2022 - APR 2022]</i></p>
    <p>
     This project proposed a method to derive uncertainty of entities in
        events with respect to context. The proposed method has been applied to
        the news dataset created using Twitter data and proves to be useful for
        identification of important events and entities from the document. [<a
