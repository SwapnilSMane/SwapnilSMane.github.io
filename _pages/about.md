<p align="justify">I'm a PMRF Ph.D. scholar in the Social Network Analysis and Application Group (SoNAA) led by <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://sumankundu.info/" target="_blank">Dr. Suman Kundu</a> at IIT Jodhpur (Currently at IIT Madras) and collaborating with <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://rajeshsharma.cs.ut.ee/" target="_blank">Dr. Rajesh Sharma</a>. My research lies at the intersection of natural language processing, graph-based learning (Graph Neural Networks), and social computing. It focuses on developing knowledge-augmented (Retrieval Augmented Generation), LLM-based, and graph-based models to understand and forecast user aggression on social media by integrating textual, social, and temporal signals for robust, explainable, and multilingual analysis.</p>
