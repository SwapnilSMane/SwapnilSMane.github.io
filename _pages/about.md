Under construction ingnore the content!!

Welcome! I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am also an affiliated
researcher with the [Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org)
and a research collaborator with the 
[Research on International Policy Implementation Lab](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil).

I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. This [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily
focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org).

I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department of Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (<a href="http://www.iiitd.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIIT-Delhi</a>).   

I worked as a Research Scientist in the AI & Machine Learning Systems group of GE Global Research Center (<a href="http://www.geglobalresearch.com/" target="_blank">GE GRC</a>), Niskayuna, NY, USA. My work involved building knowledge graphs from unstructured and semi-structured data, and using them for predictive analytics.   

I was a PhD student in the Data Semantics Lab (<a href="http://dase.cs.wright.edu/" target="_blank">DaSe Lab</a>), affiliated to the Computer Science department of Wright State University (<a href="http://www.wright.edu/" target="_blank">WSU</a>), OH, USA. My advisor was <a href="http://www.pascal-hitzler.de/" target="_blank">Dr. Pascal Hitzler</a>. I also worked closely with <a href="http://cecs.wright.edu/~pmateti/PM/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Prabhaker Mateti</a>. 

I completed my Masters in Computer Science from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (<a href="http://www.mnnit.ac.in/" target="_blank">MNNIT</a>), Allahabad, India and my Bachelors in Computer Science from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (<a href="http://www.jntuh.ac.in/" target="_blank">JNTU</a>), Hyderabad, India.  

I am interested in Semantic Web and building large scale systems. The work done during my PhD revolves around these interests. My thesis work in particular, explores scalable approaches for ontology reasoning.
